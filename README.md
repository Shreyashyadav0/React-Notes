# React-Notes
React notes with all the self and internet resources 
when ever we are changing the style in jsx html we have to use camel case for all of them.  

Conditinal rendering

const state = true

( state && console.log("hello") ) this just bit wise operator where secons will be operated only if first is true.

 <div>
            {props.setup && <h3>{props.setup}</h3>}
            {isShown && <p>{props.punchline}</p>}
            <button onClick={toggleShown}>{isShown ? "Hide" : "Show"} Punchline</button>
            <hr />
        </div>
most of the time we will be using && or ternary ? : like this .

1. What is "conditional rendering"?
When we want to only sometimes display something on the page
based on a condition of some sort


2. When would you use &&?
When you want to either display something or NOT display it


3. When would you use a ternary?
When you need to decide which thing among 2 options to display


4. What if you need to decide between > 2 options on
   what to display?
Use an `if...else if... else` conditional or a `switch` statement


function App() {
    let someVar
    if () {
        someVar = <SomeJSX />
    } else if() {
        ...
    } else {
        ...
    }
    return (
        <div>{someVar}</div>
    )
}
