# React-Notes
React notes with all the self and internet resources 
when ever we are changing the style in jsx html we have to use camel case for all of them.  

Conditinal rendering

const state = true

( state && console.log("hello") ) this just bit wise operator where secons will be operated only if first is true.

 <div>
            {props.setup && <h3>{props.setup}</h3>}
            {isShown && <p>{props.punchline}</p>}
            <button onClick={toggleShown}>{isShown ? "Hide" : "Show"} Punchline</button>
            <hr />
        </div>
most of the time we will be using && or ternary ? : like this .

1. What is "conditional rendering"?
When we want to only sometimes display something on the page
based on a condition of some sort


2. When would you use &&?
When you want to either display something or NOT display it


3. When would you use a ternary?
When you need to decide which thing among 2 options to display


4. What if you need to decide between > 2 options on
   what to display?
Use an `if...else if... else` conditional or a `switch` statement


function App() {
    let someVar
    if () {
        someVar = <SomeJSX />
    } else if() {
        ...
    } else {
        ...
    }
    return (
        <div>{someVar}</div>
    )
}



Forms

Forms


1. In a vanilla JS app, at what point in the form submission
   process do you gather all the data from the filled-out form?
Right before the form is submitted.


2. In a React app, when do you gather all the data from
   the filled-out form?
As the form is being filled out. The data is all held in local state.


3. Which attribute in the form elements (value, name, onChange, etc.)
   should match the property name being held in state for that input?
`name` property.


4. What's different about saving the data from a checkbox element
   vs. other form elements?
A checkbox uses the `checked` property to determine what should
be saved in state. Other form elements use the `value` property instead.


5. How do you watch for a form submit? How can you trigger
   a form submit?
- Can watch for the submit with an onSubmit handler on the `form` element.
- Can trigger the form submit with a button click.

USE STATE

    // side effects
    React.useEffect(function() {
        console.log("Effect ran")
        // fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people/1")
        //     .then(res => res.json())
        //     .then(data => console.log(data))
    }, [count])  // [0] compared to [0]
   

1. What is a "side effect" in React? What are some examples?
- Any code that affects an outside system.
- local storage, API, websockets, two states to keep in sync


2. What is NOT a "side effect" in React? Examples?
- Anything that React is in charge of.
- Maintaining state, keeping the UI in sync with the data, 
  render DOM elements


3. When does React run your useEffect function? When does it NOT run
   the effect function?
- As soon as the component loads (first render)
- On every re-render of the component (assuming no dependencies array)
- Will NOT run the effect when the values of the dependencies in the
  array stay the same between renders


4. How would you explain what the "dependecies array" is?
- Second paramter to the useEffect function
- A way for React to know whether it should re-run the effect function
