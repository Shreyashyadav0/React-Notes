React Notes
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

Components and Props
Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a detailed component API reference here.

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.


The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:
function Components(props){
return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;	
}

fuction Welcome(props){
return <h1> Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
const element = <Welcome name = "Sara"/>;
root.render(element);
Note:Always start component names with a capital letter.
